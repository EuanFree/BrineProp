* Works in Dymola with MSL 3.2.1 

(you need to load MSL 3.2.1 first via File>Libraries>MSL, then open package, 
after conversion make changes marked with "MSL 3.2.1" in PartialMixtureTwoPhaseMedium to get rid of warnings. After the changes it will not work in MSL 3.2 anymore).

Getting started

Run models from BrineProp/Examples

Documentation
